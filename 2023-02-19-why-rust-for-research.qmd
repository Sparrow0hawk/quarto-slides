# What is Rust?

- Programming language that came out of Mozilla
- Designed with an emphasis on security, peformance and usability 
- Initially popular for systems based programming but **very** flexible

# What is great about Rust?

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Rust is great!")
}
```

## Safety

- Rust enforces memory safety
- The borrow checker within the compiler tracks object lifetime of references at compile time
- Strongly and statically typed: all types must be known at compile time

## Performance

- No garbage collection
- Built ontop of LLVM toolchain

## Flexiblity

- Initially popular in the systems programming space
- But now applied to:
  - Embedded systems
  - Web (strong support for web assembly)
  - Online services
  - Machine learning backend ([Hugging Face Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers), [Pola.rs](https://www.pola.rs/))

# What is not so great about Rust...


```rust
error[E0369]: cannot multiply `&str` by `{integer}`
 --> src/main.rs:3:17

  |            ---- ^ -- {integer}
